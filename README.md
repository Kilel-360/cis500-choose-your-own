# Project 4: Define Your Own Project

GitHub Classroom link:  ()

Your assignment for Project 4 is to 
1. Do something cool
2. Show me what you've learned in CIS 500
3. Learn something new

That's it.  Be creative, have fun, do something that will make your future courses easier.

## Some ideas

* Implement a game (Connect 4, Solitaire Pig Dice, Chess,  etc.)
* Write a game "helper"
    * Play chess/checkers
    * https://www.thewordfinder.com/wordle-solver (colors optional)
* Analyze / visualize a data set.
* Find some security logs and write a simple threat scanner
* Do something that will help you learn a useful library
  * `Tkinter` (the GUI library) (https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
  * `numpy` (a scientific computing library) (https://numpy.org/)
  * `pandas` (a data analysis library) (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  * `matplotlib` (a plotting/visualization library) (https://matplotlib.org/)

Remember: The program doesn't have to be huge or fancy.  The main purpose is to show me what 
you learned in CIS 500 and what you can do with Python.

## Rules

* This is an _individual_ project.
* The main part of the project needs to be code you wrote.  Don't just copy something from the Internet. (You are welcome and encouraged to download and use Python libraries like `numpy` and `pandas`.)
* The project can be related to projects in your other courses, but there need to be a significant component of the CIS 500 project that is not a requirement for another course.
* You need to have automated tests (either unit tests, or end-to-end tests).
* Use the GitHub classroom link above to create the repository for your project. (You need to use a GitHub classroom repository so I can easily view and grade the projects.  You are welcome to move your code at the end of the semester.)

## Rubric

To meet expectations, your project must
* Run correctly without errors
* Be sufficiently complex to serve as a semester project (i.e., it can't be too easy)
* Be written cleanly (using good design, good variable names, etc.)
